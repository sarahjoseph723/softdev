    <h3> What is Haskell? </h3>
    <p>Haskell is a <b>polymorphically</b> (values can have more than one type). <b>statically typed</b> language. It utilizes <b>lazy evaluation</b> (expressions which are not needed to determine the answer to a problem aren&#39t evaluated), and is <b>purely functional,</b> (it's evaluated like math). The syntax is mathematically derived, so it's pretty easy to pick up.

    <h3> Pros and Cons </h3>
    <div id="container">
      <div id="left">
	<h4 align="center">Pros</h4>
	<ul>Functional programs make it easier and cheaper to write large software (in terms of basic logic and testing, can then be translated)</ul>
	<ul>Smaller semantic gap between programmer and language</ul>
	<ul>Shorter, clearer, more maintainable, fewer errors, higher reliability</ul>
	<ul>Good for programs that need to be highly modifiable and maintainable</ul>
	<ul>Higher productivity</ul>
      </div>
      <div id="right">
      <h4 align="center">Cons</h4>
      <ul>Code tends to be slower than equivalent in other languages</ul>
      <ul>Difficult to debug (however, much less bugs to deal with)</ul>

    <h3> Functional Languages </h3>
    <p>In functional languages, all the code is essentially treated like a single expression that gets evaluated. Order doesn't  matter the same way it does in C or in Java (in languages like those if you put your functions in a different order you may get a different result, whereas in Haskell that doesn't happen). Functional languages like Haskell are strongly typed, so there are no <a id=-"link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump"><b>core dumps</b>.</a></p>
